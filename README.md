This is a VM-Manager currently written in Python with PySimpleGUI and it uses Qemu. It's for creating and managing VMs

## Functions
- Making new VMs with Settings which will be saved
- Running the saved VMs in a .sh or .bat File

## Requirments
- Qemu installed and added to your $PATH

## Plans
- Deleting VMs (this will be an Easy one)
- Better saving Format for the VMs (yeah possible)
- Editing VMs (also an Easy one)
- Runing VMs with media inside (also an Easy one)
- Changing from Python to some other Language for GUI (When I know who to write GUI Apps in like C++ I will port it, but until then I need to stick to Python)
- Mac Support (Maybe)

## Support
- You can Fork it if you want to I always like help :)
- Open a Issue when something doesn't work and I will try to help
